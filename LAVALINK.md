## ⚙️ Installation

- Trying to run a Lavalink? Here are a few brief steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't want to host your own node, you can consider using one of the [public nodes](https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com) maintained by the community.

### 📋 Install Java

- This in case you do not have Java installed.

1. Go to [this site](https://adoptium.net/es/temurin/releases/?package=jdks)
2. Look for your OS. (Windows, Linux, etc...)
3. Select the Java version of your choice (17 or newer)
4. Download the `.msi` file
5. Install

### 📋 Lavalink node

- Go to the Lavalink repository and download the [latest version](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases).

1. Create a directory.
2. Go to your directory with cd. `cd my-node`
3. Drop the `jar` and the `application.yml`
4. Start the node.

You can use my example:

- [`application.yml`](/assets/application.yml)
- [`start scripts`](/assets)

_Just do `./start.bat` if you are on Windows_
_Or `sh start.sh` if you are on a ubuntu server_

### 📋 Using the node

- Just, go to the [configuration](/src/structures/utils/data/Configuration.ts#L20) of Mirai and add the node to the list.
